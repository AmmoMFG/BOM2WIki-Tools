# BOM2WIki-Tools

This is a relatively short-set of tools that make it easier to format complicated data to a local or internal Wiki. Most are/will be written in stock perl to make them as simple as possible to use.

Every tool here is written with this in mind: Do X so I can get back to Y.

List of utilities:

  csv2wiki.pl - Just what it sounds like, converts a CSV (comma separated value) to Wiki table format. No frills, just works.
